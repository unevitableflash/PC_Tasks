## 📁 Contents :

- `prob_statement.md` – Problem description (optional, if outside Polygon)
- `test_case.cpp` – Test case generator, written using testlib.h
- `validator.cpp` – Input validator
- `testlib.h` – Testlib header (for generator and validator)
- `testindex.in` – Sample or generated test cases
- `sol.cpp` - Correct solution to this problem

## 🛠️ How to Use :

To generate test cases:
```bash
g++ test_case.cpp -o gen
./gen m n > testindex.in

IT WILL CREATE A MATRIX HAVING DIMENSIONS M AND N, THE MATRIX WILL BE FILLED WITH ZEROES AND ONES.
